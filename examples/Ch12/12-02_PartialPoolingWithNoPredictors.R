## Figure 12.1

# Caption: "Figure 12.1 Estimates Â± standard errors for the average log radon
# levels in Minnesota counties plotted versus the (jittered) number of
# observations in the county: (a) no-pooling analysis, (b) multilevel (partial
# pooling) analysis, in both cases with no house-level or county-level
# predictors. The counties with fewer measurements have more variable esti-
# mates and larger higher standard errors. The horizontal line in each plot
# represents an estimate of the average radon level across all counties. The
# left plot illustrates a problem with the no-pooling analysis: it
# systematically causes us to think that certain counties are more extreme, just
# because they have smaller sample sizes." [253]

# "The no-pooling analysis overfits the data within each county. To see this,
# consider Lac Qui Parle County (circled in the plot), which has the highest
# average radon level of all 85 counties in Minnesota. This average, however, is
# estimated using only two data points." [253]
