# GelmanHill

Examples and data from [Gelman &amp; Hill 2007](http://amzn.to/1P7BUME).

I downloaded the materials from [this page](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/software/) and stored them in this repository. I'm taking the liberty to modify the examples and rename the files as I work through them.

BUGS is no longer preferred. We should Stan instead. There are [Stan versions](https://github.com/stan-dev/example-models/tree/master/ARM) of the BUGS scripts.
